  <h3><a name="event" id="event"></a><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In various situations it is needed that the servers and the clients are decoupled. In abstract terms this means
  that information producers do not know nor care about the parties that are interested in the information, and the
  information consumers do not know nor care about the source or sources of the information. All they know is that they
  produce or consume information on a certain subject.<br></p>

  <p>Here does the Event Server fit in nicely. It is a third party that controls the flow of information
      about certain subjects (&quot;events&quot;). A <em>publisher</em> uses the Event Server to publish
      a message on a specific subject. A
  <em>subscriber</em> uses the Event Server to subscribe itself to specific subjects, or to a pattern
  that matches certain subjects. As soon as new information on a subject is produced (an &quot;event&quot; occurs)
  all subscribers for this subject receive the information. Nobody knows (and cares) about anybody else.<br>
  </p>

  <p>It is important to rembember that all events processed by the ES are transient, which means they are not stored.
  If there is no listener, all events disappear in the void. The store-and-forward programming model is part of a
  messaging service, which is not what the ES is meant to do. It is also important to know that all subscription data
  is transient. Once the ES is stopped, all subscriptions are lost. The clients that are subscribed are not notified of
  this! If no care is taken, they keep on waiting forever for events to occur, because the ES doesn't know about them
  anymore!<br></p>

  <p>Usually your subscribers will receive the events in the order they are published. However, this is <em>not
  guaranteed</em>. If you rely on the exact order of receiving events, you must add some logic to check this (possibly
  by examining the event's timestamps). The chance of events not arriving in the order they were published is very,
  very small in a high-performance LAN. Only on very high server load, high network traffic, or a high-latency (WAN?)
  connection it is likely to occur.</p>

  <p>Another thing to pay attention to is that the ES does not guarantee delivery of events. As mentioned above, the ES
  does not have a store-and-forward mechanism, but even if everything is up and running, the ES does <em>not</em>
  enhance Pyro's way of transporting messages. This means that it's still possible (perhaps due to a network error)
  that an event gets lost. For reliable, guaranteed, asynchronous message delivery you'll have to look somewhere else,
  sorry ;-)</p>

  <p>The ES is a multithreaded server and will not work if your Python installation doesn't have thread support.
  Publications are dispatched to the subscribers in different threads, so they don't block eachother. Please note that
  events may arrive at your listener in multithreaded fashion! Pyro itself starts another thread in your listener to
  handle the new event, possibly while the previous one is still being handled. <em>The<code>event</code> method may be
  called concurrently from several threads.</em> If you can't handle this, you have to use some form of thread locking
  in your client! (see the <code>threading</code> module on <code>Semaphore</code>), or
  <code>Pyro.util.getLockObject</code>. Keep in mind that one of the things that requires a thread lock is <em>calling
  Pyro methods on a Pyro object</em>, because the proxy cannot be shared among different threads!<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">To summarize:<br></span></p>

  <ul>
    <li>decoupled event listeners and event producers; many-to-many<br></li>

    <li>topic based communication</li>

    <li>subscription to unique topics or topic patterns</li>

    <li>events are transient and will disappear if nobody is listening</li>

    <li>not a means of guaranteed or asynchronous messaging</li>

    <li>multithreading mode required<br></li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="starting" id="starting"></a>Starting the Event Server</h3>Start the ES using the <code>pyro-es</code> command
  from the <code>bin</code> directory (use <code>pyro-es.cmd</code> on windows). You can specify the following
  arguments:<br><br>
  pyro-es [-h] [-n hostname] [-p port] [-i identification]

  <dl>
    <dt>-h</dt>

    <dd>Print help.</dd>

    <dt>-n hostname</dt>

    <dd>Change the hostname/ip address the server binds on. Useful with multiple network adapters.</dd>

    <dt>-p port</dt>

    <dd>Change the port number the server uses. (Omit to use Pyro defaults, 0 to let the operating system choose a random port).</dd>

    <dt>-i identification</dt>

    <dd>Specify the authentication passphrase that will be required to connect to this server. If it contains spaces,
    use quotes around the string. The same identification is also used to connect to other Pyro servers such as the
    Name Server. (this is required ofcourse when the Name Server has been started with the -i option).</dd>

    <dt><br>
    There is also: <code>pyro-essvc</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;(Windows-only Event Server 'NT-service' control scripts)</dt>

    <dd>- Arguments: [options] install|update|remove|start [...]|stop|restart [...]<br>
    - On windows NT (2000/XP) systems, it's possible to register and start the Event server as a NT-service. You'll
    have to use the <code>essvc.cmd</code> script to register it as a service. Make sure you have Pyro properly
    installed in your Python's site-packages. Or make sure to register the service using an account with the correct
    PYTHONPATH setting, so that Pyro can be located. The ES service logs to <code>C:\Pyro_ES_svc.log</code> where C: is
    your system drive.<br>
    You can configure command line arguments for this service in the Registry. The key is:
    <code>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PyroES</code>, and the value under that key is:
    <code>PyroServiceArguments</code> (REG_SZ, it will be asked and created for you when doing a <code>essvc.cmd
    install</code> from a command prompt).<br>
    <em>Running the ES as a windows NT service it not well supported.</em></dd>
  </dl>

  <p><strong>Like the Name Server, if you want to start the Event Server from within your own program</strong>,
      you can ofcourse start it by executing the start script mentioned above. You could also use the
  <code>EventServiceStarter</code> class from the <code>Pyro.EventService.Server</code> module to start
  it directly (this is what the script also does). Be sure to start it in a separate process or thread
  because it will run in its own endless loop. Have a look at the &quot;AllInOne&quot; example to see how
  you can start the Event Server using the
  <code>EventServiceStarter</code> class.<br>
  You probably have to wait until the ES has been fully started, call the <code>waitUntilStarted()</code> method on the
  starter object. It returns true if the ES has been started, false if it is not yet ready. You can provide a timeout
  argument (in seconds).</p>

  <p>To start the ES you will first have to start the Name Server because the ES needs that to register itself. After
  starting the ES you will then see something like this:<br></p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
*** Pyro Event Server ***<
Pyro Server Initialized. Using Pyro V3.2
URI= PYRO://192.168.1.40:7766/c0a8012804bc0c96774244d7d79d5db3
Event Server started.
</pre>

  <h4>Configuration options<br></h4>There are two config options specifically for the ES:
  <code>PYRO_ES_QUEUESIZE</code> and <code>PYRO_ES_BLOCKQUEUE</code>. Read about them in the <a href=
  "3-install.html">Installation and Configuration</a> chapter. By default, the ES will allocate moderately sized queues
  for subscribers, and publishers will block if such a queue becomes full (so no events get lost). You might want to
  change this behavior. Every subscriber has its own queue. So if the queue of a slow subscriber fills up, other
  subscribers are still serviced nicely. By setting <code>PYRO_ES_BLOCKQUEUE</code> to <code>0</code>, new messages for
  full queues are lost. This may be a way to allow slow subscribers to catch up, because new messages are put in the
  queue when there is room again. Note that only messages to the slow or frozen subscribers are lost, normal running subscribers
still receive these messages.</p>

  <h3><a name="publish" id="publish"></a>Using the Event Server (publish)<br></h3>
  The ES is just a regular Pyro object,
  with a few helper classes. Its name (to look it up in the Name Server) is available in
  <code>Pyro.constants.EVENTSERVER_NAME</code>. All subjects are case insensitive, so if you publish
  something on the &quot;stockquotes&quot; channel it is the same as if you published it on the &quot;STOCKQuotes&quot; channel.<br>

  <p>To publish an event on a certain topic, you need to have a Pyro proxy object for the ES, and then call the
  <code>publish</code> method:<code>publish(subjects, message)</code> where <code>subjects</code> is a subject name or
  a sequence of one or more subject names (strings), and <code>message</code> is the actual message. The message can be
  any Python object (as long as it can be pickled):<br></p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
import Pyro.core
import Pyro.constants
Pyro.core.initClient()
es = Pyro.core.getProxyForURI(&quot;PYRONAME://&quot;+Pyro.constants.EVENTSERVER_NAME)
es.publish(&quot;StockQuotes&quot;,( &quot;SUN&quot;, 22.44 ) )
</pre>

  <p>If you think this is too much work, or if you want to abstract from the Pyro details, you can use the
  <code>Publisher</code> base class that is provided in <code>Pyro.EventService.Clients.</code> Subclass your event
  publishers from this class. The init takes care of locating the ES, and you can just call the <code>publish(subjects,
  message)</code> method of the base class. No ES proxy code needed:</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
import Pyro.EventService.Clients

class StockPublisher(Pyro.EventService.Clients.Publisher):
    def __init__(self):
        Pyro.EventService.Clients.Publisher.__init__(self)
    def publishQuote(self, symbol, quote):
        self.publish(&quot;StockQuotes&quot;, ( symbol, quote) )

sp = StockPublisher()
sp.publishQuote(&quot;SUN&quot;, 22.44)
</pre>

  <h4>Authentication passphrase</h4>The <code>__init__</code> of both the Publisher and the Subscriber takes an
  optional <code>ident</code> argument. Use this to specify the authentication passphrase that will be used to connect
  to the ES (and also to connect to the Name Server).

  <h3><a name="subscribe" id="subscribe"></a>Using the Event Server (subscribe)</h3>
  As pointed out above, the ES is
  just a regular Pyro object, with a few helper classes. Its name (to look it up in the Name Server)
  is available in
  <code>Pyro.constants.EVENTSERVER_NAME</code>. All subjects are case insensitive, so if you publish
  something on the &quot;stockquotes&quot; channel it is the same as if you published it on the &quot;STOCKQuotes&quot; channel.<br>

  <p>Event subscribers are a little more involved that event publishers. This is becaue they are full-blown
      Pyro server objects that receive calls from the ES when an event is published on one of the topics
      you've subscribed to! Therefore, your clients (subscribers) need to call the Pyro daemon's <code>handleRequests</code> or
  <code>requestLoop</code> (just like a Pyro server). They also have to call <code>Pyro.core.initServer()</code>because
  they also act as a Pyro server. Furthermore, they usually have to run as a multithreaded server, because
  the ES may call it as soon as a new event arrives and you are not done processing the previous event.
  Single-threaded servers will build up a backlog of undelivered events if this happens. You still get
  all events (with the original timestamp - so you could skip events that &quot;have expired&quot; to catch
  up). You can change this behavior by changing the before mentioned config items.</p>

  <h4>Subscribing to receive information</h4>The Event Server has a few important methods that you'll be using to
  subscribe:<br>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>subscribe(subjects, subscriber)</code></td>

        <td>Subscribe to events. <code>subjects</code> is a subject name or a sequence of one or more subject names
        (strings), and <code>subscriber</code> is <em>a proxy</em> for your subscriber object</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>subscribeMatch(subjectPatterns, subscriber)</code></td>

        <td>Subscribe to events based on patterns. <code>subjectPatterns</code> is a subject <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">pattern</span> or a sequence of one or more subject patterns (strings), and
        <code>subscriber</code> is <em>a proxy</em> for your subscriber object</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>unsubscribe(subjects, subscriber)</code></td>

        <td>Unsubscribe from subjects. <code>subjects</code> is a subject or subject <span style=
        "font-style: italic;">pattern</span> or a sequence thereof, and <code>subscriber</code> is <em>a proxy</em> for
        your subscriber object</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>But first, create a subscriber object, which must be a Pyro object (or use delegation). The subscriber object
  should have an <code>event(self, event)</code> method. This method is called by the ES if a new event arrives on a
  channel you subscribed to. <code>event</code> is a <code>Pyro.EventService.Event</code> object, which has the
  following attributes:</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>msg</code></td>

        <td>the actual message that was published. Can be any Python object.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>subject</code></td>

        <td>the subject (string) on which the message was published. (topic name)<br></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>time</code></td>

        <td>the event's timestamp (from the server - synchronised for all subscribers). A float, taken from
        <code>time.time()</code><br></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>To subscribe, call the <code>subscribe</code> method of the ES with the desired subject(s) and a proxy for your
  subscriber object. If you want to subscribe to multiple subjects based on <strong>pattern matching,</strong> call the
  <code>subscribeMatch</code> method instead with the desired subject pattern(s) and a proxy for your subscriber
  object. The patterns are standard <code>re</code>-style regex expressions. See the standard <code>re</code> module
  for more information. The pattern <code>'^STOCKQUOTE\\.S.*$'</code> matches STOCKQUOTE.SUN, STOCKQUOTE.SAP but not
  STOCKQUOTE.IBM, NYSE.STOCKQUOTE.SUN etcetera. Once more: the subjects are case insensitive. The patterns are matched
  case insensitive too.</p>

  <p>To unsubscribe, call the <code>unsubscribe</code> method with the subject(s) or pattern(s) you want to unsubscribe
  from, and a proxy for the subscriber object that has been previously subscribed. This will remove the subscriber from
  the subscription list and also from the pattern match list if the subject occurs as a pattern there. The ES
  (actually, Pyro) is smart enough to see if multiple (different) proxy objects point to the same subscriber object and
  will act correctly.<br></p>

  <h4>Using the Subscriber base class from the Event Server</h4>As you can see it can be a bit complex to get your
  subcribers up and running. An easier way to do this is to use the <code>Subscriber</code> base class provided in
  <code>Pyro.EventService.Clients. </code> Subclass your event listeners (subscribers) from this class. The init takes
  care of locating the ES, and you can just call the
  <code>subscribe(subjects)</code>,<code>subscribeMatch(subjectPatterns)</code> and <code>unsubscribe(subjects)</code>
  methods on the object itself. No ES proxy code needed. This base class also starts a Pyro daemon and by calling
  <code>listen()</code>, your code starts listening on incoming events. When you want to abort the event loop, you have
  to call <code>self.abort()</code> from within the event handler method.

  <p>The multithreading of the <code>event</code> method can be controlled using the
  <code>setThreading(threading)</code> method. If you <code>threading=</code>0, the threading will be switched off (it
  is on by default unless otherwise configured). Your events will then arrive purely sequentially, after processing
  each event. Call this method before entering the <code>requestLoop</code> or <code>handleRequests</code> or
  <code>listen.</code></p>

  <p>A minimalistic event listener that prints the stockquote events published by the example code above:<br></p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
from Pyro.EventService.Clients import Subscriber<br>
class StockSubscriber(Subscriber):
    def __init__(self):
        Subscriber.__init__(self)
        self.subscribe(&quot;StockQuotes&quot;)
    def event(self, event):
        print &quot;Got a stockquote: %s=%f&quot; % (event.msg)

sub = StockSubscriber()
sub.listen()</pre>

  <h4>Authentication passphrase</h4>

  <p>The <code>__init__</code> of both the Publisher and the Subscriber takes an optional <code>ident</code> argument.
  Use this to specify the authentication passphrase that will be used to connect to the ES (and also to connect to the
  Name Server).<br></p>

  <h3><a name="thread" id="thread"></a>Threads, Subscribers and Queues</h3>As pointed out above the events are
  delivered to your subscribers in a multithreaded way. Your subscriber may still be processing an event when the next
  one arrives. Use the <code>setThreading(threading)</code> method of the <code>Subscriber</code> base class to control
  the threading. If you set threading=0, the threading will be switched off (it is on by default). But a better way to
  process events sequentially is to use Python's <code>Queue</code> module: you create a Queue in your
  subscriber process that is filled with arriving events, and you have a single event consumer process that takes
  events out of the queue one-by-one:

  <table align="center" class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4pt; background: maroon; color: yellow; text-align: center;">Pyro Event Server</td>

      <td><em>multithreaded</em></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; font-size:150%;">&darr;</td>

      <td></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4pt; background: navy; color: white; text-align: center;">Subscriber(s)</td>

      <td><em>multithreaded</em></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; font-size:150%;">&darr;</td>

      <td></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4pt; background: teal; color: white; text-align: center;"><code>Queue.Queue</code></td>

      <td></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4pt; background: navy; color: white; text-align: center;">Consumer/Worker</td>

      <td><em>singlethreaded</em></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
