  <h2><u>3. Installation and Configuration</u></h2>Please read this entire chapter before trying to install Pyro.&nbsp;
  Not that it's complex, but just that you've seen the choices you have to make.

  <p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

  <p>Pyro distributions contain a &quot;distutils&quot; <code>setup.py</code> script that will install
      Pyro for you; just enter the following command from a shell prompt: &quot; <code>python setup.py
      install</code>&quot; and
      off you go. The script will ask if you want to install the Pyro script tools, and where to put
      them. If you want to do an automated (unattended) install, edit the <code>setup.cfg</code> file,
      following the directions in that file. <em>It will not install the
  documentation and the examples, only the core Pyro library and the scripts.</em></p>

  <p>But I will explain what exactly is in the Pyro distribution. It has a few subdirectories:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>Pyro/</code></dt>

    <dd>This is the actual Pyro package. If you do not use the supplied <code>setup.py</code> install script (see
    above) you have to install it by hand. Install this directory somewhere in your Python search path. On most systems
    (also Windows), the <code>lib/site-packages</code> directory is a nice place. The exact location might vary
    according to your specific Python installation.</dd>

    <dd>Alternatively, keep it where it is and manually add the Pyro root directory to your Python search path (e.g. in
    the environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code>).</dd>

    <dt><code>bin/</code></dt>

    <dd>This directory contains the command-line utilities. Move the contents of this directory somewhere in your shell
    search path.</dd>

    <dd>Alternatively, keep it where it is and manually add it to your shell search path.</dd>

    <dt><code>docs/</code>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>examples/</code></dt>

    <dd>Put those wherever you like. In docs you can find the Pyro manual, and in examples there are some Pyro
    examples.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>

  <p>The default settings will do nicely in most cases. But sooner or later you will have to change some parameters of
  Pyro. Pyro's configuration is accessed through <code>Pyro.config</code>. This object has several configuration
  items:<br></p>

      overhead of checksumming is very small, with regular messages less than 0.1%, but increasing with big messages
      (15% for 5 Mb or so). <strong>Note:</strong> the checksum is by no means secure. If you want secure

          want. The timeout period is system-dependent but usually around 2 hours. It depends on your
          OS how to change this value, but have a look at &quot;sysctl&quot;. (This

  <p>There are several ways to change the default settings:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Change the settings in your code, at runtime. You can change all settings before starting Pyro, and most
    settings can be changed dynamically during execution too. <em>Note that you cannot use this to change
    <code>Pyro.config.PYRO_STORAGE</code>! See below!</em><br>
    ... <code>Pyro.config.PYRO_PORT = 7000</code><br>
    ... <code>Pyro.config.PYRO_TRACELEVEL = 3</code></li>

    <li>Define environment variables that override the default settings.<br>
    Every configuration item has an equivalent environment variable. If you define this, you can override the default
    setting for that item. For instance, it might be convenient to have your Pyro programs generate log files and put
    them in a designated log directory:<br>
    ...<code>$ export PYRO_LOGFILE=/var/log/PYRO/logfile</code><br>
    ...<code>$ export PYRO_TRACELEVEL=3</code><br>
    (This is for bash - syntax is different for other shells or Windows.)</li>

    <li>Configuration files<br>
      You can use a configuration file that can contain some small configuration changes or a fully new configuration
      for all items. Pyro checks if the environment variable <code>PYRO_CONFIG_FILE</code> is set. If it isn't set, or
      set to an empty string, Pyro checks for a <code>Pyro.conf</code> file in the current directory. If it exists,
      Pyro uses it as a configuration file. If it doesn't exist, Pyro uses the default built-in configuration.<br>
      If the environment variable is set, Pyro uses the value as the name for the configuration file. If the
      configuration file can't be read, a PyroError exception occurs.

      <p>The format of the configuration file is very simple. It is a text file, and each line can be empty, a comment,
      or a configuration item setting. A comment starts with '#'. A config item setting is of the format 'ITEM=VALUE'.
      If Pyro finds an unknown config item, a KeyError exception occurs.</p>

      <p>Note that <code>PYRO_CONFIG_FILE</code> is useless inside a configuration file. After initialization, it is
      set to the absolute path of the configuration file that was used (or the empty string, if no configuration file
      was used). Note that setting <code>PYRO_CONFIG_FILE</code> from within your code is useless too because Pyro is
      already initialized at that point.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>Environment variables override configuration file settings. Configuration file settings override the built-in
  default settings.

  <p><code>PYRO_STORAGE</code> is used at initialization time, that is, as soon as a part of the Pyro package is
  imported in your program. You can only change <code>PYRO_STORAGE</code> <em>beforehand</em> by either setting the
  environment variable or making an entry in the configuration file. Changing <code>Pyro.config.PYRO_STORAGE</code> in
  your program leads to unexpected results, because the initilization has already been done using the old value. So
  don't do this, and use one of the two other ways.</p>
