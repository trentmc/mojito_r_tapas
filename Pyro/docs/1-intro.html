  <!-- ******************* INTRODUCTION ******************** -->

  <h2><u>1. Introduction</u></h2>Thank you for choosing the often regarded number one Remote Method Invocation package
  for Python!
<p>
 Pyro is short for PYthon Remote Objects. It is an advanced and powerful 
 Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python, that is 
 designed to be very easy to use. Never worry about writing network 
 communication code again, when using Pyro you just write your Python objects 
 like you would normally. With only a few lines of extra code, Pyro takes care 
 of the network communication between your objects once you split them over 
 different machines on the network. All the gory socket programming details are 
 taken care of, you just call a method on a remote object as if it were a local 
object!</p>
<p>
Pyro provides an object-oriented form of RPC. You can use Pyro within a single 
system but also use it for IPC. For those that are familiar with Java, Pyro 
resembles Java's Remote Method Invocation (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/index.html">RMI</a>).
It is less similar to <a href="http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/corbafaq.htm">CORBA</a> -
which is a system- and language independent Distributed Object Technology and 
has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI. 
But Pyro is <strong>small</strong>, <strong>simple</strong>,
  <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>free</strong>! For another overview of what Pyro is, see the Pyro page online
  (<a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a>). You can also download the package from
  there.</p>

  <p><strong>Security Warning</strong><br>
  <em>In the Security chapter is an <a href="9-security.html">important security warning</a> that you absolutely must
  read!</em></p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Written in 100% pure Python. It is small, simple and extremely portable - it runs everywhere Python runs and TCP/IP networking is available.</li>
      <li>Naming Service which keeps record of the location of objects. The location of the NS can be discovered by a broadcast mechanism, and various other ways, if your network doesn't support broadcasting. NS has option to keep its naming database persistent (on disk) so that it survives shutdowns. </li>
      <li>High-level Event Service with topic channels.</li>
      <li> Mobile objects. Clients and servers can pass objects around - even when the server has never known them before. Pyro will then automatically transfer the needed Python bytecode.</li>
      <li>Support for Python types only restricted by those that the standard 'pickle' module handles (all builtin types, and user created classes) Objects as arguments are also supported.</li>
      <li>Support for all Python argument types (variable argument lists and keyword arguments, <code>*args</code> and <code>**keywords</code>).</li>
      <li>Exceptions that occur in the remote object will actually be raised too on the client, just as if the error occured locally. Pyro's exception transportation mechanism makes this possible.</li>
      <li>Dynamic Proxies - no need for additional tools or classes.</li>
      <li>Direct remote attribute access with normal Python syntax.</li>
      <li>Server can dynamically create or remove new Pyro objects.</li>
      <li>Multithreaded server support to handle multiple requests simultaneously.</li>
      <li>Automatic reconnection in case of network connection failures.</li>
      <li>Fast one-way invocation possible.</li>
      <li>Pyro contains heavily tested network communication code that works reliable on all platforms </li>
      <li>Talk between 32-bit and 64-bit machines, regardless of processor architecture and operating system</li>
      <li>A lot of examples are included in the Pyro distribution!</li>
    </ul>


  <p><strong>To get an idea of how Pyro works, here is a scenario:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>You write a module '<code>test</code>' containing a class '<code>testclass</code>', which will be accessed
    remotely.</li>

    <li>The server creates one or more instances of the '<code>testclass</code>', and registers them with the Pyro Name
    Server.</li>

    <li>The client queries the Name Server for the location of those objects. It gets a Pyro URI (Universal Resource
    Identifier) for them.</li>

    <li>The client creates proxies for the remote objects.</li>

    <li>Because the proxy mimics the real '<code>testclass</code>', the client can now invoke methods on the remote
    objects. The proxy will forward the method invocations and return the results, just as if it was the remote object
    itself. Not a single line of network communication code has been written.</li>
  </ol>This looks like a big oversimplification, but it isn't!

  <p>To dive directly into the code, have a look at the various Pyro examples in the <code>examples</code> directory
  (read the <code>Readme.txt</code>). There is much to learn there. The easiest example to start with
  is the &quot;simple&quot;
  example, it shows how a normal python object is made into a Pyro object and accessed remotely from
  the client.</p>

  <p><strong>Required Software:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>This version of Pyro needs at least Python 2.3. However, it is strongly recommended to use the latest Python
    version available (at the time of writing 2.5).</li>

    <li>You will have to use the same major Python version everywhere to make sure the data format is compatible (if
    you are using the default builtin pickle protocol)</li>

    <li>Because basic Pyro does not depend on any third party libraries or extension modules, it runs wherever Python
    is available, however, the command line utility scripts are designed for Windows(NT) and Unix sh. You might
    experience problems trying to run them on other systems.</li>

    <li>The <code>pyro-xnsc</code> tool requires the Tkinter Python extension module, with Tcl/Tk installed.</li>

    <li>The <code>pyro-wxnsc</code> tool requires the WxPython extension module with WxWindows.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I want to thank everybody on the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyro-core">Pyro mailing
  list</a>, your participation is of great value. And to everybody who contacted me about Pyro, for positive remarks,
  comments, or with problems (it all helps to improve Pyro): Thank You!</p>

  <p>If you appreciate my efforts and would like to express your appreciation by a <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=18837">cash donation</a>, that is gladly accepted. But because I'm
  doing Pyro for fun, I've decided to support the PSF by making all donations trough SourceForge go to the <a href=
  "http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
