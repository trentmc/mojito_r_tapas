MOJITO-R-TAPAS
==============

There are two main versions of MOJITO. The basic, simplest, and most stable version is at https://github.com/trentmc/mojito. The version here is faster ("TAPAS" extension), variation-aware ("R" extension), and has a bigger topology library (>100,000 topologies).

However, this version is a bit more unstable than the basic MOJITO. For example, the unit tests are not all passing. If you want simple code and basic results, then use MOJITO. Only use this version if you want to levearag its extra benefits (variation, speed, or larger library).
