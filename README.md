MOJITO-R-TAPAS
==============

The "plain" version of MOJITO is at: https://github.com/trentmc/mojito

This is the "advanced" version of MOJITO, which includes:
 * Variation-awareness ("MOJITO-R")
 * Faster ("MOJITO-TAPAS")
 * Larger library of topologies (>100,000)

However, this version is a bit more unstable than "plain" MOJITO. For example, the unit tests are not all passing. If you want simple code and basic results, then use MOJITO. Only use this version if you want to levearag its extra benefits (variation, speed, or larger library).

"MOJITO-R" was described at: T. McConaghy, P. Palmers, M. Steyaert, and G.G.E. Gielen, Trustworthy genetic programming-based synthesis of analog circuit topologies using hierarchical domain-specific building blocks, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 15(4), Aug. 2011, pp. 557-570. http://trent.st/content/2011-TEVC-mojito-ea.pdf

"MOJITO-TAPAS" was described at: P. Palmers, T. McConaghy, M. Steyaert, and G.G.E. Gielen, Massively multi-topology sizing of analog integrated circuits, in Proc. Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE), March 2009. trent.st/content/2009_DATE_mojito_tapas.pdf
