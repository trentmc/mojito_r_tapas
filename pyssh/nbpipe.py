"""Implements a non-blocking pipe class."""

# Since it uses thread rather than select, it is portable to at least
# posix and windows environments.

# TO DO:
#     * Handle excpetions better, particularly Keyboard Interupts.
#     * Possibly do a threadless version for posix environments
#       where we can use select (is probably more efficient).
#     * A test function.
